###**Epic on FHIR**
All EPIC FHIR EMR data collected are de-identified by filtering PHI before storing in the cloud. Documentation for data being collected can be found here:
https://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR

###**Garmin**
All data available from the Health API is categorized as different types of summary data. Push integrations receive this data directly from the Push notification POST body, but Ping/Pull integrations must call the Health API with requests signed with the Consumer Key (representing the partner) and the UAT (representing the user) via OAuth. The summary data should be archived by the partner, as the Health API only keeps user data for fifteen days from the upload date.

Documentation for Garmin's summary data types are availble for registered users. To access this please contact the developers.
